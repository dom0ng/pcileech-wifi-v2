# Usage
This firmware was created for researching purposes only.  

# Original project by ekknod based on Ulf Frisk pcileech-fpga project
Original project can be found from https://github.com/ekknod/pcileech-wifi

# Anti-Cheats
This project was created to test current top Anti-Cheats against FPGA approach with minimal effort / knowledge.  

It work on VANGUARD on specific AMD motherboard (no idea why, vanilla firmware or others firmware are blocked here).
Otherwise, VANGUARD block it on 99% of motherboards, when the real device is not blocked.
The real device is blocked without wifi connection tho.


Faceit dosn't have technology to differenciate between the real device and the rogue cloned firmware.
They have decided to totally block this device based on his vid/pid or configuration space.

Blocking an orignal and legal wifi card. Good job to FACEIT.
They also block original and legal capture card like Avermedia GC573.
Good job again.

Update : detected by drvscan as 12/07/2024 :-) I let you figure out alone
drvscan will detect 99% of lazy firmware. this one was a lazy project (aroun 25min to get it done "right")
