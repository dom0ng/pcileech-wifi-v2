# Anti-Cheats
This project was created to test current top Anti-Cheats against FPGA approach with minimal effort / knowledge.  

It work on VANGUARD on specific AMD motherboard (no idea why, vanilla firmware or others firmware are blocked here).
Otherwise, VANGUARD block it on 99% of motherboards, when the real device is not blocked.
The real device is blocked without wifi connection tho.

Faceit introduced drvscan-like tech recently, checking for active connection (WMI interface)
