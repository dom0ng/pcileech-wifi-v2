# Usage

# Original project by ekknod based on Ulf Frisk pcileech-fpga project
Original project can be found from https://github.com/ekknod/pcileech-wifi

# Anti-Cheats
This project was created to test current top Anti-Cheats against FPGA approach with minimal effort / knowledge.  

~~It work on VANGUARD on specific AMD motherboard (no idea why, vanilla firmware or others firmware are blocked here).~~
~~Otherwise, VANGUARD block it on 99% of motherboards, when the real device is not blocked.~~
The real device is blocked without wifi connection tho.

Faceit introduced drvscan-like tech recently, checking for active connection (WMI interface) and active packet.

EAC have catch up and are very similar to top tier anti-cheats.
It will still work on specific AMD motherboard (no idea wwhy, or :D)

Good job to everyone
